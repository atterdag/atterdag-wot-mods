Options in the config file (AT_ServerMarker_config.json):

"texture" 
            Sets the texture for the gun marker. These files are located in the "markers"
            directory as ".dds" files. Templates are included for creating new markers in 
            the Paint.net image editor. 
            
"textureScaleArcade"
"textureScaleSniper"
            Sets the size of the gun marker textures. 1.0 is unscaled.
            
"markerScaleServer":
"markerScaleClient":
            Accepted values: 0.1-2.0
            Sets the size of the gun marker. 1.0 is unscaled.
            The client marker minimum and maximum size is unchanged.

"preventTeamDamage"
            Helps prevent shooting an ally if the ally is directly in front of the client
            gun marker.
            
"showOnTop"
            Position the server gun marker on top of the aim.
            
"showUnsupported"
            Display build in server marker when using an unsupported control mode (such 
            as artillery).

"minimumSizeLimit"
            Will limit the minimum size similarly to the client gun marker.
